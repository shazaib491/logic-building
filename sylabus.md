### Day 1: **Introduction to Logic Building**
- **What is Logic?**
  - Definition of logic in programming.
  - How computers think and process instructions.
- **Basic Problem-Solving Approach**
  - How to break a problem into smaller steps.
  - Flow of solving problems: input, process, output.
  - Example: Simple daily life logic (e.g., making tea).

### Day 2: **Understanding Algorithms**
- **What is an Algorithm?**
  - Definition and real-life examples.
  - Step-by-step instructions to solve problems.
  - Writing simple algorithms: Adding two numbers.
- **Flowcharts**
  - Introduction to flowcharts.
  - How to represent algorithms visually.
  - Simple flowchart creation for common tasks (e.g., traffic lights).

### Day 3: **Introduction to Pseudocode**
- **What is Pseudocode?**
  - Writing logic in plain language before coding.
  - Examples of pseudocode for basic tasks.
- **Simple Exercises**
  - Create pseudocode for tasks like making a sandwich or checking if a number is even or odd.

### Day 4: **Basic Logical Constructs**
- **Conditional Statements**
  - Introduction to `if-else` logic.
  - Real-life examples (e.g., if it's raining, carry an umbrella).
- **Loops**
  - Introduction to looping (e.g., `for` and `while` loops).
  - Practical example: Counting from 1 to 10 using a loop.

### Day 5: **Problem Solving with Logic**
- **Combining Conditional and Loops**
  - How conditions and loops work together.
  - Problem-solving examples: Finding the largest of three numbers.
- **More Practice with Pseudocode and Flowcharts**
  - Practice writing pseudocode and drawing flowcharts for everyday problems (e.g., ATM withdrawal process).

### Day 6: **Debugging and Logical Thinking**
- **Common Logical Errors**
  - Misunderstandings in flow and structure.
  - How to avoid mistakes when building logic.
- **Debugging Basics**
  - Importance of testing and debugging.
  - How to trace errors and fix logic in simple pseudocode.

### Day 7: **Final Exercise and Recap**
- **Create a Simple Program Flow**
  - Final task: Write pseudocode and flowcharts for a basic program (e.g., a number guessing game).
- **Recap Key Concepts**
  - Revisit important points: breaking problems, writing pseudocode, using logic.
  - Encourage students to think logically before writing code.

This syllabus helps students understand the foundation of logic without diving into coding right away.
